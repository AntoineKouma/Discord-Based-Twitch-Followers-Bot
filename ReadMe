Dear Twitch Bot Supporters

The Twitch Bot Project is terminated and we can no longer provide any help.
If you are gaming or trying to grow your audience we will be happy to have you in our discord server https://discord.com/invite/YYxwA3z8RT
There you can find some amazing content creators, streamers and gamers to support so let’s all together unite and help each other! 
If you’ve already joined and left we are very sorry but you have been banned. You can subscribe to our YouTube channel and ask to rejoin the server https://bit.ly/2EuVtlc
Just to be clear, we never provided any services and we are not the owners of the aforementioned or any bot that is out there. 
We just found that bot and decided to share with everyone. Thank you.
